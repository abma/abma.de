I've created a techtree from <a href="http://springrts.com/wiki/Balanced_Annihilation">Balanced Annihilation</a>. As you can see... it's a little complex ;-)  See the attached PDF.  The file was created with graphiz:

	dot -Tpdf techtree.dot -o techtree.pdf

The .dot file was created with the AI i'm currently working at, see the <a href="http://agai.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=agai/agai;a=blob;f=agai/info/IBuildTree.java;h=c6aead0e5b8260db59843efc4109c388a835fa18;hb=71d3e9cd7e21d521d69b01fe1bf18925fcce227a">source code</a> for more details
