in pymssql stored procedures can be called. some stored procedures have not output vars but return values. I couldn't find any reference to returnvalue in the docs, i only found it by reading the source code. as pseudo-code:

	cursor.callproc("function", (param1, param2))
	print(cursor.returnvalue)

{% endfilter %}
{% endblock %}
