To restore files from a partition/usb-stick/... i can recommond <a href="http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/PhotoRec">PhotoRec</a>.

It runs on most operating-systems: Linux/Windows/MacOS X/Dos/...

It is command-line only but simple to use and it supports currently about 180 file formats.

The software is based on TestDisk which can recover lost partitions.

I used it to restore about 930 pictures from a raw-image of a formated 2GB usb-stick.
