I've migrated to <a href="https://github.com/eudicots/Cactus">Cactus</a> as i'm sick of updating drupal because of security holes. Cactus is a static page generator so all pages are now static html!

The layout is still work in progress but all content should be already there. Some posts were deleted as <a href="https://blog.fefe.de/">Fefe</a> and <a href="https://netzpolitik.org">netzpolitik.org</a> do a much better job! :-)

For feedback / pull requests please create a new issues at the <a href="https://github.com/abma/abma.de">Bug Tracker</a>.
