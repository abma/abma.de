James Harper is writing a <a href="http://lists.xensource.com/archives/html/xen-devel/2007-11/msg00089.html">GPLed PV-drivers for Windows</a>. There are a few issues, but the first working driver should'nt be so far away, because the source is already released and many users needs this stuff.  (me too) :)
