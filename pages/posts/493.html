sometimes places.sqlite can become quiet big and slow down firefox. to clean up its possible to delete old history data with some sql-commands:

	sqlite3 places.sqlite
	delete from moz_historyvisits where visit_date < strftime('%s', 'now', '-1 month') * 1000 * 1000;
	vacuum;

this will delete all recent visits older than 1 month.

{% endfilter %}
