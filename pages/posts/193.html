If you have removed a scsi-device, but forgot to unmount it, you'll get messages like this one:

	Nov  2 22:18:01 192.168.0.50 kernel: Buffer I/O error on device sdd, logical block 0
	Nov  2 22:18:01 192.168.0.50 kernel: Buffer I/O error on device sdd, logical block 1
	Nov  2 22:18:01 192.168.0.50 kernel: Buffer I/O error on device sdd, logical block 2
	Nov  2 22:18:01 192.168.0.50 kernel: Buffer I/O error on device sdd, logical block 3
	Nov  2 22:18:01 192.168.0.50 kernel: Buffer I/O error on device sdd, logical block 5119

To remove "dead" scsi-devices, type

	echo 1&gt; /sys/block/sdX/device/delete

where sdX the dead device is. Be careful, don't remove devices you are currently using!  To rescan for (new) scsi-devices type

	echo "- - -" &gt; /sys/class/scsi_host/hostX/scan

where X is the host adapter id. (Should be 0)  If the Volumesize was changed, then following command re-reads the volume size:

	echo 1 &gt; /sys/block/sdc/device/rescan

(tested with custom linux-2.6.20-xen-r7)
