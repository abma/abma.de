In the last weeks i switched some servers from Xen to KVM. Why?

My big points to switch were:

The bugtracker isn't maintained, <a href="http://bugzilla.xensource.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1038">a bug</a> i reported about 2 years ago is marked as new! It is fixed, but it doesn't look like the xen-developers have a good contact to the community.

The (Hypervisor-)Xen-support seems to go never into the mainline kernel. KVM is from the early beginning there, this makes different problems: if you want to use xen, you have to use a very old kernel (2.6.18).

KVM is supported by one of the biggest linux distributions: ubuntu.

KVM supports nested virtualization: it allows to run a hypervisor in a guest domain!

Xen seems to be unstable, i had many crashes or kernel panics while installing. I tryed many differnt kernels and configs to get a domU paravirtualized running. When it runs, i had problems too with lvm for example. KVM+Virtio works like a charm and i can use the vanilla-kernel without any problems :)
