<p>A long time ago i searched a tool to mount cd-images like .MDS .ISO .CUE with linux. There was none... only things like mount -o loop were avaiable.</p><p>Today i've found <a href="http://cdemu.sourceforge.net/">cdemu</a>: it does all i want, it only installs a very small kernel module to emulate a Virtual (SCSI) Host Bus Adapter, the rest is done in userspace.</p><p>There is also the small GUI gCDEmu to &quot;mount&quot; an image. It is a gnome-panel applet.  Thumbs up! :-)</p>
