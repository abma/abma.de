This is a service from a Brother Printer, if you don't have such a printer, try the <a href="http://welcome.solutions.brother.com/bsc/public/us/us/en/dlf/dlf/000000/000600/dlf000618.html?reg=us&amp;c=us&amp;lang=en&amp;prod=hl1240_all&amp;type2=2&amp;os=7&amp;flang=4&amp;dlid=dlf000618">Brother Printer Driver Uninstall Tool</a>.

I've posted this, because i didn't find an other easy solution. When i manually deleted the service, the service show up after a reboot.
