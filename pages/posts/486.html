{% extends "post.html" %}
{% block body %}

{% load markup %}
{% filter markdown %}

if "%PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE%" == "x86" (
       echo "System is 32 bit"
   ) else (
      echo "System is 64 bit"
   )

There are some other solutions, too, but this seems to be the most efficient. This way only works, if you are using the 64 bit cmd.exe:

Microsoft has a solution, too, but it required to create a temp-file:
