If you want to migrate a Physical to a Virtual Host or vice versa then you can use the attached files to enable the default IDE drivers on the running system.
before doing so, please make a backup! :-)
I used the Script to convert a Windows XP running in VirtualBox to be executed in KVM. Without doing so i got a 0x0000007B bluescreen.
The .reg file is from Microsoft, the .cmd should be self-explaining :)
kvm supports .vdi files so the VirtualBox machine can be run directly with kvm:

	kvm -hda windows.vdi

The image then finally can be converted with

	qemu-img convert -O qcow2 windows.vdi windows.qcow2

If that doesn't work the VBoxManage tool from Virtualbox should do the job too:

	VBoxManage clonehd -format RAW windows.vdi windows.img
